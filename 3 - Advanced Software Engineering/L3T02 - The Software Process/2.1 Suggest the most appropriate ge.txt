2.1 Suggest the most appropriate generic software process model that might be used as a basis for managing the development of the following 
systems.Explain your answer according to the type of system being developed:

**A system to control antilock braking in a car: for this system, the book describes the waterfall development process.  These are best for
embedded systems and also critical systems. The idea of an antilock breaking system for a car can be considered as a critical system because
testing for this system is a huge part of finalizing the "product" / system. The waterfall system is also very rigid which can be
also hindering while building this system. Overall, a waterfall model seems most appropriate.

**A virtual reality system to support software maintenance: Incremental; virtual reality is still a new piece of software. This means, that 
there is most likely going to be many different changes. By breaking the project into smaller pieces, by presenting to the customers, they 
are able to receive feedback, which will allow them to build, or take away certain features.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**A university accounting system that replaces an existing system: Integration and Configuration. By using the integration and configuration
process, we could also assume that the new system will take reusable components from the older system and integrate them into the new system
,but with better, or improved features.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**An interactive travel planning system that helps users plan journeys with the lowest environmental impact: Incremental. This system is 
dependent on the user's interaction and imput. This means that there will be heavy testing done throughout the process to ensure that 
the system will perform as the user seeks fit. This system allows the user testing early in the prcess to ensure that the best product 
is being made. This also needs to be flexible with change in perspective to the user's feedback.
