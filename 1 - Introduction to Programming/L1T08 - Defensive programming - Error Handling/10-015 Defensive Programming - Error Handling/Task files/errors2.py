animal = "Lion" # The string variable contain syntax errors because of no inverted commas.

# 'full_spec' contains syntax and logical errors because of no inverted commas seperating string sentences from variables.
# Variables has logical errors because of misplacement within string.
full_spec = "This is a " + animal +  ". It is a " + animal_type +  " and it has " + str(number_of_teeth) + " teeth."

print(full_spec) # The print function was a syntax error because it didn't have parenthesis.
