Scenario 1
An algorithm that asks a user to enter a positive number repeatedly
until the user enters a zero value, then determines and outputs the
largest of the numbers that were input

Algorithm 1
Request user to enter positive number repeatedly.
if until the user enter a zero value.
print the largest of values that user inputed.

Scenario 2
An algorithm that requests a user to input their name and then
stores their name in a variable called first_name. Subsequently, the
algorithm should print out first_name along with the phrase “Hello,
World”.

Algorithm 2
Request user to input name.
Store the name in variable called first_name.
print first_name and the phrase "Hello, world".

Scenario 3
An algorithm that reads an arbitrary number of integers and then
returns their arithmetic average.

Algorithm 3
input  arbitrary integers.
add up integers to get the total value.
divide the total value of integers by the total number of integers
to get the arithmetic average.
print arithmetic average.

Scenario 4
An algorithm that reads a grocery list and prints out the products
(in alphabetical order) that are still left to buy (you can decide what
these are).

Algorithm 4
Request grocery list from user.
store list in variable called grocery_list.
mark what was bought on the grocery_list.
print what still needs to be bought.

Scenario 5
An algorithm for the flowchart below:

Algorithm 5
input value for X.
input value for Y.
total value of X and Y = S variable
the value of S variable / 2 = A variable
X value * Y value = P varible
print S,A,P.
